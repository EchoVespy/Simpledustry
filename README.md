# Simpledustry

A scuffed as hell WORK IN PROGRESS texture pack made for mindustry.

The goal of this texture pack is to get rid of as much detail as possible for every sprite in mindustry, while still retaining a recognizable appearance.

HUGE thanks to the Factoriodustry mod and their developers for the code they made for it, as this mod is currently using it as well (although i'd like to change that in the future)

EVERYTHING is subject to change, when exactly i do not know.

currently the mod fully works on v6, and works on v7 as well except for the environment sprites (natural ground and walls, plus ores)


Fully sprited by EchoVespy only.
